I'm a Pennsylvania-based cloud security professional who loves learning. I started my career in tech in a non-technical internship at SAP America during my final semester of mathematics undergraduate. My job was relatively simple - summarize customer use-cases of SAP software. Through this role, I was able to learn about the different ways SAP software solutions were being leveraged, the different ways the software was deployed, and the different partners that SAP interacted with. From there, I landed my first technical role as a Support Engineer. In this role I began to expand my technical skills by learning about SQL optimization and general application-level optimization. I also began to interact with SAP's PaaS offering at this time, which allowed me to begin to learn cloud principles. My interest in the cloud and cloud security grew during this time, which ultimately led me to my next role at SAP. 

After two years as a Support Engineer, I transfered to my current role on a Security Operations team, working as a DevSecOps Engineer. I'm challenged daily in this role, learning new concepts every day. I've picked up new skills with Terraform, Chef Inspec, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure, Alicloud, etc. While working on developing in-house security visibility tools with open source technologies, I also work hand in hand with internal stakeholders to lead their lines of business to a more secure posture.

In my freetime, I enjoy brewing beer, making espresso-based drinks, playing guitar, fishing, snowboarding, and thrifting.
